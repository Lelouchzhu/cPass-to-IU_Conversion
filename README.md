# cPass to IU Conversion
cPass reading (% inhibition) to International Units (IU)/ml of the WHO International Standard

Using data representing 21 biological replicas from three international groups, we obtained a highly reproducible calibration of cPass reading (% inhibition) to International Units (IU)/ml of the WHO International Standard with a correlation efficient R(2) at 0.978. We have developed a convenient Excel-based conversion tool.

Raw data from China, Monaco and Singapore was placed on the Sheet named "Raw".
Correlation of cPass reading and log10 IU was modelled in a logistic ression, done by binomial settings of glm in the R software (4.0.2).

The conversion of cPass reading to IU can be done by using the "IU_calculator" Tab. "Plate_reader" can be used to convert the readings from plate reader with the settings of negative controls into IU/mL for each well.
